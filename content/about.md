# About Dave
I am a `coder` â€“ this is just a place to experiment with ui concepts.

### Current focus

I have been working primarily with Vue and Nuxt as a frontend environment. I enjoy the productivity boost that the two offer, aim to utilize some of my recent work around authentication, data visualization, and devops tooling to build a fun playground.

### Daily thoughts

I use [nuxt](https://nuxt.com) for prototyping and exploring interesting ideas. The data I work with is geospatial in nature and I enjoy using modern toolchains to create interactive apps, maps, and visualizations.

### Nuxt Studio

Not the easiest thing to get working, but I was able to use my [marr.github.io](https://github.com/marr) repo to publish this website. 

<!-- You need to manually set the deploy branch to `gh-pages` from within github repo settings. Honestly it was a challenge and really tested my patience. Subsequent deploys were not always happening. -->
