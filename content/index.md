I've been working on some projects with nuxt, ai, and geolocation.

- [nuxt-maplibre](https://dm.nuxt.space/nuxt-maplibre) is a nuxt module that allows swapping in map providers in a declarative way.
- [context labs](https://contextlabs.com) is where I work on tools for the worlds largest energy companies to monitor and address their GHG emissions.
- [model context protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) is helping me integrate LLMs (AI) with modern web technology to create applications faster than I ever have before.
- [@vercel/ai](https://v5.ai-sdk.dev) is a new SDK for building integrations between model providers like OpenAI, Anthropic, and Azure and front-end web meta-frameworks like React and Vue.
