Some of my recent work includes:

- [nuxt-maplibre](https://marr.github.io/nuxt-maplibre) is a nuxt module that allows swapping in map providers in a declarative way.
- [vue-squircle](https://marr.github.io/vue-squircle) turns your rounded corners into more interesting *squircles*.
- [](https://contextlabs.com)I work at [context labs](), where we build tools to help monitor and address emissions in energy products.
- [@vercel/ai](https://v5.ai-sdk.dev) is a new SDK for building integrations between model providers like OpenAI, Anthropic, and Azure and front-end web meta-frameworks like React and Vue.
