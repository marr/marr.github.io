# Welcome to my site

This is a new start to sharing some of the things I like to do with my development time outside of work.

## Current Focus

Right now (Jan 2025), I have been working primarily with Vue and Nuxt as a frontend environment. I enjoy the productivity boost that the two offer, and feel more fluid when moving around in the component landscape. I aim to integrate some of my recent work around authentication, data visualization, and devops tooling.

## Data Munging on the Daily

I use the [Observable Framework]() as well as their online platform for prototyping and exploring interesting data sets. The data I work with is geospatial in nature and offering immersive detail with mapping is something I find fun to do.

## Integrate Vue Component
