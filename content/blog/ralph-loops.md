With a good-enough plan, you could walk away from your computer – and have it build an entire company for you.

## The concept

You break down a plan into tasks. AI can help with this.

Once you have a decent plan, you can run a `while` command in your terminal that continuously restarts the claude or whatever agent you are using with the result of the previous prompt.

The loop focuses on a single task at a time and is always working on the most important one. Once the task is finished, it is marked complete, and goes on to the next one – using a fresh context window.

Using this method, you aren't subject to context rot, or lossy session compaction.
